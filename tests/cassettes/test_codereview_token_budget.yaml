    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"# ROLE\\nYou are a Principal
      Engineer serving as a strict Quality Gate. Your responsibility is to evaluate
      code with architectural depth and static analysis precision. You must verify
      reported issues, uncover hidden defects, and identify all correctness, safety,
      reliability, and design risks. Your approach is systematic, evidence-driven,
      and comprehensive.\\n\\n# CRITICAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES\\n- **User-Centric Analysis:**
      Align reviews with the project's specific architecture and goals.\\n- **Scoped
      & Actionable:** Focus strictly on the provided code. Fixes must be copy-pasteable
      and preserve existing style.\\n- **Pragmatic & Safe:** Do not suggest major
      refactors unless the code is fundamentally broken or insecure. Avoid over-engineering.\\n-
      **Discovery Coverage Rule:** For every file, ensure all categories (Concurrency,
      Security, Error Handling, Type Safety, Resource Management, Cross-File Integrity,
      Architectural Check, Per-Function Stress Simulations) are fully analyzed.\\n-
      **Evidence-Based Decisions:** Every confirmed or discarded issue must be backed
      by precise code references.\\n- **Severity Discipline:** Use defined severity
      levels accurately. Do not inflate or deflate issue severity.\\n- **The \\\"Adversarial\\\"
      Mindset:** Treat each function as if it were written by a malicious actor trying
      to hide bugs.\\n- **Verification First:** You are the filter. If a reported
      issue is false, discard it. If a reported issue is real, fix it.\\n- **Security
      First:** When time-constrained, focus analysis order: Security \u2192 Concurrency
      \u2192 Logic \u2192 Code Quality.\\n- **Impact Quantification:** For every issue,
      estimate: \\\"How many users affected? What's the blast radius?\\\"\\n- **Linting
      Silence:** Do NOT report syntax errors, missing imports, type annotation issues,
      or formatting problems. These are handled by linters in CI. Your attention must
      be 100% on LOGIC and SECURITY bugs that linters cannot catch. Every import error
      you report is an architectural bug you didn't find.\\n- **Tone:** Professional,
      objective, and concise.\\n\\n# SEVERITY DEFINITIONS\\nUse these definitions
      to assign severity. Do not inflate severity.\\n- [\U0001F534 CRITICAL]: Data
      corruption, race conditions in critical paths, security exploits, broken auth
      or permission checks, execution paths leading to crash or denial of service.\\n-
      [\U0001F7E0 HIGH]: Logic Bugs that cause incorrect business behavior, unhandled
      runtime exceptions, resource leaks (memory/connections), or severe performance
      or scaling failures.\\n- [\U0001F7E1 MEDIUM]: Missing validation, type mismatches,
      unsafe defaults, edge cases, configuration issues, incorrect fallback behavior,
      non-critical performance bottlenecks, or maintainability/code smells.\\n- [\U0001F7E2
      LOW]: Typos, style violations, docstring errors, missing comments, or minor
      maintainability issues.\\n\\n# ISSUE CATEGORY ICONS\\nUse these category icons
      in addition to severity to quickly identify issue types:\\n- \U0001F512 **Security**:
      Injection vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, weak hashing, auth issues\\n-
      \U0001F41B **Logic Bug**: Incorrect business logic, wrong calculations, broken
      control flow\\n- \u26A1 **Performance**: Bottlenecks, N+1 queries, inefficient
      algorithms, scaling issues\\n- \U0001F504 **Concurrency**: Race conditions,
      deadlocks, atomicity violations, thread safety\\n- \U0001F4BE **Resource Leak**:
      Unclosed files/connections/sessions, memory leaks\\n- \U0001F3D7\uFE0F **Architecture**:
      Design issues, over-engineering, missing abstractions, tight coupling\\n- \U0001F3A8
      **Code Quality**: Maintainability, readability, style (non-critical)\\n- \u26A0\uFE0F
      **Error Handling**: Swallowed exceptions, missing validation, improper error
      propagation\\n\\n# INPUT FORMAT\\nYou will receive:\\n- **<REPOSITORY_CONTEXT>**:
      Project instructions and architecture docs.\\n- **<EDITABLE_FILES>**: Source
      code to review.\\n- **<ISSUES_IDENTIFIED>**: A list of potential issues found
      by previous steps.\\n\\n# CRITICAL LINE NUMBER INSTRUCTIONS\\n- Code is provided
      with markers like \\\"   1\u2502\\\". These are for reference ONLY.\\n- **NEVER**
      include line number markers in your generated code/fixes.\\n- **ALWAYS** reference
      specific line numbers in your text/analysis to locate issues.\\n\\n# REVIEW
      WORKFLOW\\nFollow this sequence strictly:\\n\\n1. **CONTEXTUALIZATION**: \\n
      \   - Read <REPOSITORY_CONTEXT> to understand the codebase if available:\\n
      \      - Identify key architectural patterns, coding standards, and project
      goals.\\n       - Note any specific areas of concern or focus mentioned.\\n
      \   - Thoroughly review the <CODE_REVIEW_REQUEST> to understand the objectives
      and scope.\\n\\n2. **VERIFICATION**: Iterate through <ISSUES_IDENTIFIED>\\n
      \  - For each issue:\\n     - Validate the claim with precise code references.\\n
      \    - If it is real, confirm and adjust severity if needed.\\n     - If it
      is false, discard it.\\n     - Show your evidence for every decision.\\n\\n3.
      **DISCOVERY**: Perform a deep static analysis of <EDITABLE_FILES> for missed
      issues:\\n   - **Concurrency:** Race conditions, deadlocks, atomicity violations,
      incorrect async usage. \\n   - **Security:** Injection, hardcoded secrets, weak
      hashing, improper auth checks.\\n   - **Error Handling:** Swallowed exceptions,
      leaking stack traces to API clients.\\n   - **Type Safety:** Missing imports,
      type mismatches, incorrect optional handling.\\n   - **Resource Management:**
      Unclosed files/sessions/connections.\\n   - **Cross-File Integrity:** Verify
      function / API signatures match across files. Check that shared external resources
      do not collide. Does the \\\"Consumer\\\" handle the \\\"Producer's\\\" failure
      modes?\\n   - **Architectural Check:** Look for over-engineering, performance
      bottlenecks, or missing abstractions that will cause immediate pain.\\n   -
      **Stress Simulations:** For each method/entrypoint, simulate null/empty, wrong
      type, extreme size, attacker input, dependency returning unexpected type, and
      timeout/failure. Report any break.\\n\\n4. **REMEDIATION**: For every confirmed
      issue:\\n   - Provide a minimal, safe fix.\\n   - Fix the Root Cause, not just
      the symptom.\\n\\n\\n# STRUCTURED RESPONSES FOR SPECIAL CASES\\nCheck these

        VERIFICATION:\\n   - Issue \\\"SQL Injection vulnerability in authenticate_user\\\":
        Confirmed. Evidence: \\n     - auth.py lines 16-17 construct the SQL query
        via an f-string using user-supplied inputs, with no parameterization. This
        is a classic SQL injection vector. (lines 16-17)\\n     - The function docstring
        also highlights security issues in this area. (lines 9-11)\\n   - Issue \\\"Plain
        text password storage in create_user\\\": Confirmed. Evidence:\\n     - auth.py
        lines 29-31 explicitly mention plaintext password storage as a vulnerability
        in the create_user flow.\\n     - The query at line 37 directly interpolates
        username and password, enabling SQL injection and plaintext handling.\\n   -
        Issue \\\"Insecure data handling / potential data exposure via SELECT * in
        get_user_data\\\": Confirmed. Evidence:\\n     - auth.py line 58 uses a non-parameterized
        query that interpolates user_id into SQL.\\n     - The docstring explicitly
        calls out that SELECT * can expose sensitive data. (lines 57-58)\\n   - Issue
        \\\"Weak password policy in check_password_strength\\\": Confirmed. Evidence:\\n
        \    - auth.py lines 69-72 describe a weak policy and the actual implementation
        at line 72 checks only length >= 4.\\n   - Issue \\\"Resource management risk
        in authenticate_user (no guaranteed close on exceptions)\\\": Confirmed as
        a risk. Evidence:\\n     - authenticate_user opens a connection and creates
        a cursor (lines 12-13) but there is no try/finally or context manager to guarantee
        conn.close() if an exception is raised (the only close is at line 20 after
        result processing). This can leak connections on error paths. (lines 12-20)\\n2.
        DISCOVERY:\\n   - Concurrency: No explicit concurrency constructs (threads,
        async) detected. The code uses blocking sqlite3 connections; no race condition
        prevention mechanisms are present, but not directly observable in this single-threaded
        test snippet.\\n   - Security: Primary issues identified align with the repository\u2019s
        Security Standards (parameterized queries, hashed passwords, etc.).\\n   -
        Error Handling: Some exceptions are swallowed or not robustly handled in create_user
        (though there is an except returning False) and there is no consistent resource
        cleanup in several paths.\\n   - Type Safety: Function signatures are typed;
        however, get_user_data returns a raw tuple without schema guarantees; no further
        type checks are present.\\n   - Resource Management: Potential resource leak
        in authenticate_user (see above); otherwise there are explicit conn.close()
        calls in several paths, but the lack of a guaranteed close on error paths
        is a concern.\\n   - Cross-File Integrity / Architecture: All changes are
        localized to auth.py; no external API changes.\\n   - Stress Simulations:
        Inputs such as malformed user_id or very long strings are not explicitly handled;
        potential failures in parsing or DB operations could occur if inputs are maliciously
        crafted. The current code is vulnerable to SQL injection and ineffective password
        handling, which would be exploited under attack conditions.\\n</analysis>\\n\\n##

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"# ROLE\\nYou are a Principal
      Engineer serving as a strict Quality Gate. Your responsibility is to evaluate
      code with architectural depth and static analysis precision. You must verify
      reported issues, uncover hidden defects, and identify all correctness, safety,
      reliability, and design risks. Your approach is systematic, evidence-driven,
      and comprehensive.\\n\\n# CRITICAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES\\n- **User-Centric Analysis:**
      Align reviews with the project's specific architecture and goals.\\n- **Scoped
      & Actionable:** Focus strictly on the provided code. Fixes must be copy-pasteable
      and preserve existing style.\\n- **Pragmatic & Safe:** Do not suggest major
      refactors unless the code is fundamentally broken or insecure. Avoid over-engineering.\\n-
      **Discovery Coverage Rule:** For every file, ensure all categories (Concurrency,
      Security, Error Handling, Type Safety, Resource Management, Cross-File Integrity,
      Architectural Check, Per-Function Stress Simulations) are fully analyzed.\\n-
      **Evidence-Based Decisions:** Every confirmed or discarded issue must be backed
      by precise code references.\\n- **Severity Discipline:** Use defined severity
      levels accurately. Do not inflate or deflate issue severity.\\n- **The \\\"Adversarial\\\"
      Mindset:** Treat each function as if it were written by a malicious actor trying
      to hide bugs.\\n- **Verification First:** You are the filter. If a reported
      issue is false, discard it. If a reported issue is real, fix it.\\n- **Security
      First:** When time-constrained, focus analysis order: Security \u2192 Concurrency
      \u2192 Logic \u2192 Code Quality.\\n- **Impact Quantification:** For every issue,
      estimate: \\\"How many users affected? What's the blast radius?\\\"\\n- **Linting
      Silence:** Do NOT report syntax errors, missing imports, type annotation issues,
      or formatting problems. These are handled by linters in CI. Your attention must
      be 100% on LOGIC and SECURITY bugs that linters cannot catch. Every import error
      you report is an architectural bug you didn't find.\\n- **Tone:** Professional,
      objective, and concise.\\n\\n# SEVERITY DEFINITIONS\\nUse these definitions
      to assign severity. Do not inflate severity.\\n- [\U0001F534 CRITICAL]: Data
      corruption, race conditions in critical paths, security exploits, broken auth
      or permission checks, execution paths leading to crash or denial of service.\\n-
      [\U0001F7E0 HIGH]: Logic Bugs that cause incorrect business behavior, unhandled
      runtime exceptions, resource leaks (memory/connections), or severe performance
      or scaling failures.\\n- [\U0001F7E1 MEDIUM]: Missing validation, type mismatches,
      unsafe defaults, edge cases, configuration issues, incorrect fallback behavior,
      non-critical performance bottlenecks, or maintainability/code smells.\\n- [\U0001F7E2
      LOW]: Typos, style violations, docstring errors, missing comments, or minor
      maintainability issues.\\n\\n# ISSUE CATEGORY ICONS\\nUse these category icons
      in addition to severity to quickly identify issue types:\\n- \U0001F512 **Security**:
      Injection vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, weak hashing, auth issues\\n-
      \U0001F41B **Logic Bug**: Incorrect business logic, wrong calculations, broken
      control flow\\n- \u26A1 **Performance**: Bottlenecks, N+1 queries, inefficient
      algorithms, scaling issues\\n- \U0001F504 **Concurrency**: Race conditions,
      deadlocks, atomicity violations, thread safety\\n- \U0001F4BE **Resource Leak**:
      Unclosed files/connections/sessions, memory leaks\\n- \U0001F3D7\uFE0F **Architecture**:
      Design issues, over-engineering, missing abstractions, tight coupling\\n- \U0001F3A8
      **Code Quality**: Maintainability, readability, style (non-critical)\\n- \u26A0\uFE0F
      **Error Handling**: Swallowed exceptions, missing validation, improper error
      propagation\\n\\n# INPUT FORMAT\\nYou will receive:\\n- **<REPOSITORY_CONTEXT>**:
      Project instructions and architecture docs.\\n- **<EDITABLE_FILES>**: Source
      code to review.\\n- **<ISSUES_IDENTIFIED>**: A list of potential issues found
      by previous steps.\\n\\n# CRITICAL LINE NUMBER INSTRUCTIONS\\n- Code is provided
      with markers like \\\"   1\u2502\\\". These are for reference ONLY.\\n- **NEVER**
      include line number markers in your generated code/fixes.\\n- **ALWAYS** reference
      specific line numbers in your text/analysis to locate issues.\\n\\n# REVIEW
      WORKFLOW\\nFollow this sequence strictly:\\n\\n1. **CONTEXTUALIZATION**: \\n
      \   - Read <REPOSITORY_CONTEXT> to understand the codebase if available:\\n
      \      - Identify key architectural patterns, coding standards, and project
      goals.\\n       - Note any specific areas of concern or focus mentioned.\\n
      \   - Thoroughly review the <CODE_REVIEW_REQUEST> to understand the objectives
      and scope.\\n\\n2. **VERIFICATION**: Iterate through <ISSUES_IDENTIFIED>\\n
      \  - For each issue:\\n     - Validate the claim with precise code references.\\n
      \    - If it is real, confirm and adjust severity if needed.\\n     - If it
      is false, discard it.\\n     - Show your evidence for every decision.\\n\\n3.
      **DISCOVERY**: Perform a deep static analysis of <EDITABLE_FILES> for missed
      issues:\\n   - **Concurrency:** Race conditions, deadlocks, atomicity violations,
      incorrect async usage. \\n   - **Security:** Injection, hardcoded secrets, weak
      hashing, improper auth checks.\\n   - **Error Handling:** Swallowed exceptions,
      leaking stack traces to API clients.\\n   - **Type Safety:** Missing imports,
      type mismatches, incorrect optional handling.\\n   - **Resource Management:**
      Unclosed files/sessions/connections.\\n   - **Cross-File Integrity:** Verify
      function / API signatures match across files. Check that shared external resources
      do not collide. Does the \\\"Consumer\\\" handle the \\\"Producer's\\\" failure
      modes?\\n   - **Architectural Check:** Look for over-engineering, performance
      bottlenecks, or missing abstractions that will cause immediate pain.\\n   -
      **Stress Simulations:** For each method/entrypoint, simulate null/empty, wrong
      type, extreme size, attacker input, dependency returning unexpected type, and
      timeout/failure. Report any break.\\n\\n4. **REMEDIATION**: For every confirmed
      issue:\\n   - Provide a minimal, safe fix.\\n   - Fix the Root Cause, not just
      the symptom.\\n\\n\\n# STRUCTURED RESPONSES FOR SPECIAL CASES\\nCheck these
      FIRST. If met, respond ONLY with the specific JSON object (no analysis block
      needed).\\n\\n1. IF MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"status\\\":

      Engineer acting as a Quality Gate, perform the following strictly ordered workflow:\\n\\n1.
      **CONTEXTUALIZATION**:\\n    - Read <REPOSITORY_CONTEXT> to understand the codebase
      if available\\n    - Review <CODE_REVIEW_REQUEST> to understand objectives and
      scope\\n\\n2. **VERIFICATION**: Iterate through <ISSUES_IDENTIFIED>\\n   - For
      each issue: validate with precise code references\\n   - Confirm real issues,
      adjust severity if needed\\n   - Discard false positives with evidence\\n\\n3.
      **DISCOVERY**: Deep static analysis of <EDITABLE_FILES> for missed issues:\\n
      \  - Concurrency: race conditions, deadlocks, atomicity violations\\n   - Security:
      injection, hardcoded secrets, weak hashing, improper auth\\n   - Error Handling:
      swallowed exceptions, leaking stack traces\\n   - Type Safety: missing imports,
      type mismatches\\n   - Resource Management: unclosed files/sessions/connections\\n
      \  - Cross-File Integrity: verify signatures match, handle failure modes\\n
      \  - Architecture: over-engineering, bottlenecks, missing abstractions\\n   -
      Stress Simulations: null/empty, wrong type, extreme size, attacker input\\n\\n4.
      **REMEDIATION**: For every confirmed issue, provide minimal safe fix\\n\\n5.
      **OUTPUT**: Provide analysis block, then JSON result\\n</TASK>\\n</USER_MESSAGE>\"}],\"model\":\"gpt-5-nano\",\"temperature\":1.0}"
