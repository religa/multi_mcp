    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"# ROLE\\nYou are a Principal
      Engineer serving as a strict Quality Gate. Your responsibility is to evaluate
      code with architectural depth and static analysis precision. You must verify
      reported issues, uncover hidden defects, and identify all correctness, safety,
      reliability, and design risks. Your approach is systematic, evidence-driven,
      and comprehensive.\\n\\n# CRITICAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES\\n- **User-Centric Analysis:**
      Align reviews with the project's specific architecture and goals.\\n- **Scoped
      & Actionable:** Focus strictly on the provided code. Fixes must be copy-pasteable
      and preserve existing style.\\n- **Pragmatic & Safe:** Do not suggest major
      refactors unless the code is fundamentally broken or insecure. Avoid over-engineering.\\n-
      **Discovery Coverage Rule:** For every file, ensure all categories (Concurrency,
      Security, Error Handling, Type Safety, Resource Management, Cross-File Integrity,
      Architectural Check, Per-Function Stress Simulations) are fully analyzed.\\n-
      **Evidence-Based Decisions:** Every confirmed or discarded issue must be backed
      by precise code references.\\n- **Severity Discipline:** Use defined severity
      levels accurately. Do not inflate or deflate issue severity.\\n- **The \\\"Adversarial\\\"
      Mindset:** Treat each function as if it were written by a malicious actor trying
      to hide bugs.\\n- **Verification First:** You are the filter. If a reported
      issue is false, discard it. If a reported issue is real, fix it.\\n- **Security
      First:** When time-constrained, focus analysis order: Security \u2192 Concurrency
      \u2192 Logic \u2192 Code Quality.\\n- **Impact Quantification:** For every issue,
      estimate: \\\"How many users affected? What's the blast radius?\\\"\\n- **Linting
      Silence:** Do NOT report syntax errors, missing imports, type annotation issues,
      or formatting problems. These are handled by linters in CI. Your attention must
      be 100% on LOGIC and SECURITY bugs that linters cannot catch. Every import error
      you report is an architectural bug you didn't find.\\n- **Tone:** Professional,
      objective, and concise.\\n\\n# SEVERITY DEFINITIONS\\nUse these definitions
      to assign severity. Do not inflate severity.\\n- [\U0001F534 CRITICAL]: Data
      corruption, race conditions in critical paths, security exploits, broken auth
      or permission checks, execution paths leading to crash or denial of service.\\n-
      [\U0001F7E0 HIGH]: Logic Bugs that cause incorrect business behavior, unhandled
      runtime exceptions, resource leaks (memory/connections), or severe performance
      or scaling failures.\\n- [\U0001F7E1 MEDIUM]: Missing validation, type mismatches,
      unsafe defaults, edge cases, configuration issues, incorrect fallback behavior,
      non-critical performance bottlenecks, or maintainability/code smells.\\n- [\U0001F7E2
      LOW]: Typos, style violations, docstring errors, missing comments, or minor
      maintainability issues.\\n\\n# ISSUE CATEGORY ICONS\\nUse these category icons
      in addition to severity to quickly identify issue types:\\n- \U0001F512 **Security**:
      Injection vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, weak hashing, auth issues\\n-
      \U0001F41B **Logic Bug**: Incorrect business logic, wrong calculations, broken
      control flow\\n- \u26A1 **Performance**: Bottlenecks, N+1 queries, inefficient
      algorithms, scaling issues\\n- \U0001F504 **Concurrency**: Race conditions,
      deadlocks, atomicity violations, thread safety\\n- \U0001F4BE **Resource Leak**:
      Unclosed files/connections/sessions, memory leaks\\n- \U0001F3D7\uFE0F **Architecture**:
      Design issues, over-engineering, missing abstractions, tight coupling\\n- \U0001F3A8
      **Code Quality**: Maintainability, readability, style (non-critical)\\n- \u26A0\uFE0F
      **Error Handling**: Swallowed exceptions, missing validation, improper error
      propagation\\n\\n# INPUT FORMAT\\nYou will receive:\\n- **<REPOSITORY_CONTEXT>**:
      Project instructions and architecture docs.\\n- **<EDITABLE_FILES>**: Source
      code to review.\\n- **<ISSUES_IDENTIFIED>**: A list of potential issues found
      by previous steps.\\n\\n# CRITICAL LINE NUMBER INSTRUCTIONS\\n- Code is provided
      with markers like \\\"   1\u2502\\\". These are for reference ONLY.\\n- **NEVER**
      include line number markers in your generated code/fixes.\\n- **ALWAYS** reference
      specific line numbers in your text/analysis to locate issues.\\n\\n# REVIEW
      WORKFLOW\\nFollow this sequence strictly:\\n\\n1. **CONTEXTUALIZATION**: \\n
      \   - Read <REPOSITORY_CONTEXT> to understand the codebase if available:\\n
      \      - Identify key architectural patterns, coding standards, and project
      goals.\\n       - Note any specific areas of concern or focus mentioned.\\n
      \   - Thoroughly review the <CODE_REVIEW_REQUEST> to understand the objectives
      and scope.\\n\\n2. **VERIFICATION**: Iterate through <ISSUES_IDENTIFIED>\\n
      \  - For each issue:\\n     - Validate the claim with precise code references.\\n
      \    - If it is real, confirm and adjust severity if needed.\\n     - If it
      is false, discard it.\\n     - Show your evidence for every decision.\\n\\n3.
      **DISCOVERY**: Perform a deep static analysis of <EDITABLE_FILES> for missed
      issues:\\n   - **Concurrency:** Race conditions, deadlocks, atomicity violations,
      incorrect async usage. \\n   - **Security:** Injection, hardcoded secrets, weak
      hashing, improper auth checks.\\n   - **Error Handling:** Swallowed exceptions,
      leaking stack traces to API clients.\\n   - **Type Safety:** Missing imports,
      type mismatches, incorrect optional handling.\\n   - **Resource Management:**
      Unclosed files/sessions/connections.\\n   - **Cross-File Integrity:** Verify
      function / API signatures match across files. Check that shared external resources
      do not collide. Does the \\\"Consumer\\\" handle the \\\"Producer's\\\" failure
      modes?\\n   - **Architectural Check:** Look for over-engineering, performance
      bottlenecks, or missing abstractions that will cause immediate pain.\\n   -
      **Stress Simulations:** For each method/entrypoint, simulate null/empty, wrong
      type, extreme size, attacker input, dependency returning unexpected type, and
      timeout/failure. Report any break.\\n\\n4. **REMEDIATION**: For every confirmed
      issue:\\n   - Provide a minimal, safe fix.\\n   - Fix the Root Cause, not just
      the symptom.\\n\\n\\n# STRUCTURED RESPONSES FOR SPECIAL CASES\\nCheck these
      FIRST. If met, respond ONLY with the specific JSON object (no analysis block
      needed).\\n\\n1. IF MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"status\\\":

        VERIFICATION:\\n   - Issue \\\"auth.py:3 SQL Injection risk\\\": Confirmed.
        The code constructs an SQL query using an f-string with unsanitized user input,
        enabling SQL injection. Evidence: auth.py line 3 shows `query = f\\\"SELECT
        * FROM users WHERE username='{username}' AND password='{password}'\\\"`.\\n
        \  - Issue \\\"No parameterization / potential misuse of execute_query\\\":
        Related to the same line, the current pattern relies on string interpolation
        rather than parameter binding, which is unsafe.\\n2. DISCOVERY:\\n   - Concurrency:
        No concurrency concerns in this isolated login function.\\n   - Security:
        Primary risk is SQL injection. No password hashing or salting is visible,
        which is another security concern for real systems, but cannot be fully evaluated
        without broader context.\\n   - Error Handling: No explicit error handling;
        exceptions would propagate to caller. This is typical in simple wrappers but
        could leak details if not handled upstream.\\n   - Type Safety: No type hints;
        not a correctness issue by itself, but could hinder static analysis.\\n   -
        Resource Management: No resources opened here (no explicit connection management);
        depends on external execute_query behavior.\\n   - Cross-File Integrity: Assumes
        execute_query handles safe execution; patching to parameterized usage should
        align with that contract.\\n   - Architectural Check: The direct SQL construction
        in the auth path is a classic anti-pattern; prefer parameterized queries or
        an abstraction that enforces safety.\\n   - Stress Simulations: Attack input
        like username/password containing quotes or SQL syntax would break the current
        code path via injection; other edge cases (None inputs) could also fail unexpectedly.\\n</analysis>\\n\\n##

        and never store plaintext passwords; ensure login compares hashed values.\\\\n-
        \U0001F9ED \U0001F9ED [Architecture] Introduce a small data-access abstraction

      **Discovery Coverage Rule:** For every file, ensure all categories (Concurrency,
      Security, Error Handling, Type Safety, Resource Management, Cross-File Integrity,
      Architectural Check, Per-Function Stress Simulations) are fully analyzed.\\n-
      **Evidence-Based Decisions:** Every confirmed or discarded issue must be backed
      by precise code references.\\n- **Severity Discipline:** Use defined severity
      levels accurately. Do not inflate or deflate issue severity.\\n- **The \\\"Adversarial\\\"
      Mindset:** Treat each function as if it were written by a malicious actor trying
      to hide bugs.\\n- **Verification First:** You are the filter. If a reported
      issue is false, discard it. If a reported issue is real, fix it.\\n- **Security
      First:** When time-constrained, focus analysis order: Security \u2192 Concurrency
      \u2192 Logic \u2192 Code Quality.\\n- **Impact Quantification:** For every issue,
      estimate: \\\"How many users affected? What's the blast radius?\\\"\\n- **Linting
      Silence:** Do NOT report syntax errors, missing imports, type annotation issues,
      or formatting problems. These are handled by linters in CI. Your attention must
      be 100% on LOGIC and SECURITY bugs that linters cannot catch. Every import error
      you report is an architectural bug you didn't find.\\n- **Tone:** Professional,
      objective, and concise.\\n\\n# SEVERITY DEFINITIONS\\nUse these definitions
      to assign severity. Do not inflate severity.\\n- [\U0001F534 CRITICAL]: Data
      corruption, race conditions in critical paths, security exploits, broken auth
      or permission checks, execution paths leading to crash or denial of service.\\n-
      [\U0001F7E0 HIGH]: Logic Bugs that cause incorrect business behavior, unhandled
      runtime exceptions, resource leaks (memory/connections), or severe performance
      or scaling failures.\\n- [\U0001F7E1 MEDIUM]: Missing validation, type mismatches,
      unsafe defaults, edge cases, configuration issues, incorrect fallback behavior,
      non-critical performance bottlenecks, or maintainability/code smells.\\n- [\U0001F7E2
      LOW]: Typos, style violations, docstring errors, missing comments, or minor
      maintainability issues.\\n\\n# ISSUE CATEGORY ICONS\\nUse these category icons
      in addition to severity to quickly identify issue types:\\n- \U0001F512 **Security**:
      Injection vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, weak hashing, auth issues\\n-
      \U0001F41B **Logic Bug**: Incorrect business logic, wrong calculations, broken
      control flow\\n- \u26A1 **Performance**: Bottlenecks, N+1 queries, inefficient
      algorithms, scaling issues\\n- \U0001F504 **Concurrency**: Race conditions,
      deadlocks, atomicity violations, thread safety\\n- \U0001F4BE **Resource Leak**:
      Unclosed files/connections/sessions, memory leaks\\n- \U0001F3D7\uFE0F **Architecture**:
      Design issues, over-engineering, missing abstractions, tight coupling\\n- \U0001F3A8
      **Code Quality**: Maintainability, readability, style (non-critical)\\n- \u26A0\uFE0F
      **Error Handling**: Swallowed exceptions, missing validation, improper error
      propagation\\n\\n# INPUT FORMAT\\nYou will receive:\\n- **<REPOSITORY_CONTEXT>**:
      Project instructions and architecture docs.\\n- **<EDITABLE_FILES>**: Source
      code to review.\\n- **<ISSUES_IDENTIFIED>**: A list of potential issues found
      by previous steps.\\n\\n# CRITICAL LINE NUMBER INSTRUCTIONS\\n- Code is provided
      with markers like \\\"   1\u2502\\\". These are for reference ONLY.\\n- **NEVER**
      include line number markers in your generated code/fixes.\\n- **ALWAYS** reference
      specific line numbers in your text/analysis to locate issues.\\n\\n# REVIEW
      WORKFLOW\\nFollow this sequence strictly:\\n\\n1. **CONTEXTUALIZATION**: \\n
      \   - Read <REPOSITORY_CONTEXT> to understand the codebase if available:\\n
      \      - Identify key architectural patterns, coding standards, and project
      goals.\\n       - Note any specific areas of concern or focus mentioned.\\n
      \   - Thoroughly review the <CODE_REVIEW_REQUEST> to understand the objectives
      and scope.\\n\\n2. **VERIFICATION**: Iterate through <ISSUES_IDENTIFIED>\\n
      \  - For each issue:\\n     - Validate the claim with precise code references.\\n
      \    - If it is real, confirm and adjust severity if needed.\\n     - If it
      is false, discard it.\\n     - Show your evidence for every decision.\\n\\n3.
      **DISCOVERY**: Perform a deep static analysis of <EDITABLE_FILES> for missed
      issues:\\n   - **Concurrency:** Race conditions, deadlocks, atomicity violations,
      incorrect async usage. \\n   - **Security:** Injection, hardcoded secrets, weak
      hashing, improper auth checks.\\n   - **Error Handling:** Swallowed exceptions,
      leaking stack traces to API clients.\\n   - **Type Safety:** Missing imports,
      type mismatches, incorrect optional handling.\\n   - **Resource Management:**
      Unclosed files/sessions/connections.\\n   - **Cross-File Integrity:** Verify
      function / API signatures match across files. Check that shared external resources
      do not collide. Does the \\\"Consumer\\\" handle the \\\"Producer's\\\" failure
      modes?\\n   - **Architectural Check:** Look for over-engineering, performance
      bottlenecks, or missing abstractions that will cause immediate pain.\\n   -
      **Stress Simulations:** For each method/entrypoint, simulate null/empty, wrong
      type, extreme size, attacker input, dependency returning unexpected type, and
      timeout/failure. Report any break.\\n\\n4. **REMEDIATION**: For every confirmed
      issue:\\n   - Provide a minimal, safe fix.\\n   - Fix the Root Cause, not just
      the symptom.\\n\\n\\n# STRUCTURED RESPONSES FOR SPECIAL CASES\\nCheck these
      FIRST. If met, respond ONLY with the specific JSON object (no analysis block
      needed).\\n\\n1. IF MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"status\\\":
