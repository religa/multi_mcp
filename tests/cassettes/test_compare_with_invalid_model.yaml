        Original Question**\\n- What is 2+2?\\n\\n**2. Overview**\\n- Answer: 4.\\n\\n**3.
        Evidence Summary**\\n- No repository-specific evidence is needed; this is
        a universally true arithmetic fact. \\n- **Confidence:** \U0001F7E2 High Confidence
        \ \\n- **Depth:** \U0001F534 Shallow\\n\\n**4. Detailed Analysis**\\n- Claim:
        2+2 = 4 under standard arithmetic on natural numbers.\\n  - Using Peano-style
        definitions: 2 = S(S(0)), 4 = S(S(S(S(0)))). Addition is defined by a+0 =
        a and a+S(b) = S(a+b).\\n  - Derivation (sketch):\\n    - 2 + 0 = 2\\n    -
        2 + 1 = 2 + S(0) = S(2 + 0) = S(2) = 3\\n    - 2 + 2 = 2 + S(1) = S(2 + 1)
        = S(3) = 4\\n  - This aligns with the project\u2019s expectation of basic
        numeric operations and does not depend on any special library or framework
        in the codebase.\\n- Alternative viewpoint: In binary, 10b + 10b = 100b; in
        decimal, \u201Ctwo plus two equals four.\u201D These representations all converge
        to the same value, 4.\\n\\n**5. Trade-offs or Alternative Approaches**\\n-
        \U0001F7E2 Pros: Straightforward, universally accepted; requires no additional
        dependencies or complex logic.\\n- \U0001F534 Cons/Risks: None relevant for
        this simple fact; if you needed formal proofs in the codebase, you\u2019d
        place them in a math/core module with formal definitions (not currently present
        in this context).\\n\\n**6. Overall Confidence**\\n- \U0001F7E2 High Confidence
        \u2014 2+2 is 4 in standard arithmetic, and this fact is independent of the
        project\u2019s codebase or runtime environment.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n
